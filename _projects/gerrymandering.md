title: "Applying Areal Unit Segregation to Evaluate Racial Gerrymandering in Alabama's 2021 Congressional Districts"
year: 2019
description: "In this project, I utilize the Python GerryChain package made public by Tuft's MGGG Lab to evaluate racial segregation in Alabama's 2021 congressional districts with Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. I also utilize Saporito and Maliniakâ€™s areal unit segregation measure - baed on a nearest neighbors approach - to quantify segregation."
