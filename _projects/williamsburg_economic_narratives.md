title: "Debunking the Conservative “Paradox”: Conservative Identities and Economic Narratives in Williamsburg, Virginia"
year: 2023
description: An often articulated "conservative paradox" asks why low-income Americans continue to support conservative policies that strip the welfare they depend upon. In this study, I conducted 6 in-depth interviews with local conservative voters in Williamsburg Virginia in hopes of gaining a deeper understanding of the narratives that these voters employed to make sense of the world around them. Not only do I offer evidence from both literature and my own work against the “paradox” of conservatism, but I also discuss how urban-rural divides, a sense of disrespect, and the quiet influence of race inform my interviewees opinions on economic opportunity and inequality."
