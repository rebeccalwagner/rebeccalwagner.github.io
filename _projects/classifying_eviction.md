title: "Reddit vs. Reality: Online Perceptions of Neighborhood Safety in Washington, D.C.
year: 2024
description: "In this project, we attempt to better understand the relationship between perceptions of crime, true reported rates of crime, and housing markets, in an effort to untangle the many factors at play in gentrification. To do so, we focus specifically on the city of Washington, D.C, and utilize public datasets on crime rates and housing prices. We also collect our own dataset from social media platform Reddit through its API to create a quantification of public safety sentiment. We ultimately find that trends in perceived safety appear to lag behind changes in true crime rates, and that online safety sentiments and housing prices appear to be correlated, though more analysis is needed to parse the nature of this relationship."
