title: "Leveraging Machine Learning to Analyze Eviction Patterns in the DMV"
year: 2025
description: "In this paper, I examine evictions within the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and attempt to apply machine learning methods to explain and predict eviction filing rates. This pursuit may contribute to literature exploring populations at greatest risk of eviction, as well as providing a method for identifying areas for potential targeted policy intervention. Ultimately, I employ several classification models and identify significant predictors of eviction within a simple logistic regression pipeline."
