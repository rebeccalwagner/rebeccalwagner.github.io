title: "Leveraging Machine Learning to Analyze Eviction Patterns in the DMV"
year: 2025
description: "In this project, I utilize data on eviction filings in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area to design several classification pipelines identifing census blocks with a high eviction risk. I also consider several significant predictors of eviction, and discuss how machine learning methods can inform targeted policy interventions combating housing insecurity."
