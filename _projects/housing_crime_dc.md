title: "Reddit vs. Reality: Online Perceptions of Neighborhood Safety in Washington, D.C."
year: 2024
coauthor: Elizabeth Bagely
description: "In this project, we explore the relationships between crime rates, housing markets, and online perception of neighborhood safety in Washington, D.C. We utilize public datasets on both crime rates and housing prices, and work with Reddit's API to collect text data representing public sentiment on neighborhood safety. We ultimately find that trends in perceived safety appear to lag behind changes in true crime rates, and that online safety sentiments and housing prices appear to be correlated, though more analysis is needed to parse the nature of this relationship."
